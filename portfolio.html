    <h2>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
    <p>On the Flights team at Priceline.com, my main responsibility was to rapidly develop features given to me by our product designers. Many features on Flights either needed revamping or had to start from square one. Since I always had a curiosity about design, specifically information architecture and effective layout design, I sought to collaborate with the designers on a couple of features. Below are two production features where I was able to fully design or assist in the design process respectively.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Fare Families</h4>
    <p>One feature that our Flights application was lacking was the ability for our customers to choose a fare family (or cabin class) for their flight itinerary. The goal here was to inform the user of what amenity package was already included and also, what other packages were offered.</p>
    <img src="img/FareFamiliesBrowser.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Fare Family Desktop"></img>
    <p>To effectively display all the different types of amenities a fare had, I decided to go with collapsible buckets because
    <ul>
      <li>1. It would preserve the real estate of the page</li>
      <li>2. Allow users the ability to compare at a glance in the minimized state</li>
      <li>3. Choose which cabins to maximize to draw a comparison</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In my iterative approach to designing this module, I made an effort to fulfill two priorities&mdash;allow the user to make the most informed decision, and from a business standpoint, show the user that they can get all these other amenities if they decide to upgrade.</p>
    <p>To fulfill these objectives, I used specific design components to help the customer come to their decision. Instead of combining all the amenities into just one category, I reasoned that it would be easier for users to scan if the amenities were separated into their respective groups ("Also Includes" and "For Purchase").</p>
    <p>To achieve an effective Call-to-Action design, I used the "Upgrade Your Flight" copy and "More/Less" text to encourage users to take a second on this page and actually expand on the fares.</p>
    <img src="img/FareFamiliesDevices.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Fare Family Devices"></img>
    <p>Each fare serves as a button so users can click comfortably on all devices. To show that a fare has been selected, I opted to for a visual indicator like a blue border and used the button to convey the status of the fare (statuses are "Included", "Added" and "Upgrade"). </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Seat Selection</h4>
    <p>In an effort to improve the overall Flights experience, one of our customers' pain points was the seat selection experience. Previously, customers were only able to comfortably select seats on desktop and they were simultaneously inundated with useless information while also confused by the overal selection process.</p>
     <img src="img/FormerSeatmapsBrowser.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Former Seat Selection"></img>
    <p>So up until this redesign, a responsive experience with a mobile-first approach was yet to be implemented. With that in mind, myself and a Priceline designer decided to solve the following issues:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Allow users to select a seat on all devices</li>
      <li>2. Prominently indicate that they have selected a seat</li>
      <li>3. Make it obvious to the user that they are choosing a seat for a specific flight and a specific person</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="img/SeatSelectionDevices.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Seat Selection Devices">
    <p>For this feature, I was tasked with prototyping our seat selection ideas and deciding on the visual aspects. Keeping in mind that this time around, the seat selection experience had to be mobile-friendly, we decided that a simple flat interface with seats depicted as squares would best fit the customers' needs. To simplify the interface, we relied heavily on the header and footer to indicate what and who the seat is being chosen for.</p>
    <img src="img/SeatSelectionBrowser.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Seat Selection Desktop">
    <p>In this revamped experience, we were able to do away with information that wasn't necessary to the customer's decision-making while streamlining the process.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>For both features, my intention is always to provide the customer with a clean user interface that would work cross-platform, while also fulfilling the features' intended purpose.</p>
    <p>I was lucky that despite being a developer at Priceline.com, I was given these few opportunities to try my hand at design. Through this, I realized that I really want to learn more about UX/UI design in the real-world; to take a concept from inception all the way to a finalized user interface.</p>
    <p>Though I haven't had much experience, I'm curious, motivated, and a proven professional. I hope that I can further my design abilities and learn more from a collaborative team.</p>
