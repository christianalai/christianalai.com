          <p>Homecrowd is a side project developed by an associate that I’ve undertaken as a conceptual project to hone my
          UX design skillset. The aim of this project is to create a directory of bars to connect fans with venues that
          will be showing the game where other loyal fans will be.</p>

          <p>For this project, I was responsible for creating the new look and feel through competitive research,
          ideation, sketching, wireframing, prototyping, and testing. </p>

        </h4>
        <p>During my research into other information sources, I gathered that though Yelp and Google provided relevant results, it required substantial perusing and click-throughs to ultimately get the information. Team Bar Finder is an unknown source but it did give the most relevant information, however, it also required some amount of clicking and scrolling to retrieve the relevant details. This diagram is a high-level example of a comparison matrix. </p>

          <div class="title-text">User Research</div>
        </h4>
        <p>To understand who I was designing for, I conducted 1-on-1 interviews to deduce what the main concerns were
          and to understand what users generally look for when it comes to discovering new places to go. Through these
          interviews, I found out some key insights:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>- when it came to sports bars, the main concern was having enough TVs, seating, and good beer/food
          selection (in this order)</li>
            <li>- when it came to finding sports bars while out-of-state, Google and Yelp were the top tools to use</li>
            <li>- users would look for bars that were likely to show the games/teams they cared about</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Key Quotes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“It was nice to watch the game with someone who was rooting for the same team.”</li>
            <li>“If there is a game on, I look at photos for good seating and viewing. And then maybe reviews.”</li>
            <li> “If I were looking for a bar for a game that night, I would look for a team bar.”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After conducting these interviews, I was able to pinpoint the app’s ideal user that would be willing to use
          the app. </p>

        <p>Key Takeaways about Daniel:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>- Prefers using websites/apps that are simple and serves its purpose</li>
          <li>- Open to meeting other people/fans of the same team</li>
          <li>- Loves checking up on sports news wherever and whenever</li>

          <div class="title-text">User Flow</div>
        </h4>
        <p>I created various flow diagrams to understand the way a user would navigate a directory website.
          The following diagram depicts the typical search flow in which a user would enter the website and peruse the
          different listings.</p>

          <div class="title-text">Wireframing and Prototyping</div>
        </h4>
        <p>After rapidly sketching posibble layouts with a pencil and paper, I began to distill the final site layout
        and was able to start the process of creating wireframes, from low to medium and finally to high-fidelity.
        Below shows a quick visualization.</p>
        <img src="img/prototype-comparison.png" alt="">
        <div class="hi-fi-prototype-container">
          <p>The following images are high-fidelity wireframes depicting the different screens a user would see in a typical search flow.</p>
          <div class="homecrowd-homepage-section">
            <a href="img/search-flow/desktop-homepage.png" target="_blank">
              <img class="hi-fi-prototypes" src="img/search-flow/desktop-homepage.png" alt="">
            </a>
            <div class="homecrowd-homepage-section-text">
              <p>
                From the homepage, users would make a search based on the team they root for and where they're located. Alternatively, if there is an upcoming game, users would be able to choose the specific game from the homepage. Both searches would lead them to the page listing all the bars loyal to their team.
              </p>
              <p>Shown below are the two different search headers used depending on how the user made their search.</p>
              <div class="homecrowd-header-container">
                <a href="img/header1.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/header1.png" alt=""></a>
                <a href="img/header2.png"><img src="img/header2.png" alt=""></a>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Based on the user interviews, the deciding factor between different bars seem to be availability of seating, food, and drinks. I used images as a quick visualization to confirm the availability of these items. And based on the user persona, Daniel, this new design is an effective solution in cultivating relevant details of nearby bars to connect a community of fans wherever they are. </p>
