          <h3 class="container-title first-title">Research</h3>
          <p>In order to empathize with the people my team and I were designing for, we conducted user interviews with young professionals and asked them questions to understand the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Why and how do they currently network?</li>
            <li>What do they think of networking? If they do it, how? If they don’t, why?</li>

        <div class="insight col-md-3">
          <h6>Insight #2</h6>
          <h4>Online relationships are empty</h4>
          <p>Although “connecting” with other people has been made easy by the internet, meeting in person is still considered more meaningful in creating a relationship. So unless both parties are willing to meet in real life, all these effortless online connections remain superficial.</p>

        <div class="insight col-md-3">
          <h6>Insight #3</h6>
          <h4>Real life is intimidating</h4>
          <p>Since events happen in person, attendees are able to network in a meaningful way, however, they first have to overcome many barriers. Our users expressed reservations about “real-life networking” and would forego attending events unless they have a companion to go with.</p>

              <h6 class="mt-0 mb-3">Strength</h6>
              <p>LinkedIn is already the most popular company when it comes to professional networking so any new feature would be an extension of its existing product and won’t require extensive user acquisition and orientation.</p>
              <h6 class="mt-0 mb-3">Weakness</h6>
              <p>There’s no way to meet new people. Users can search for people but building a relationship requires both parties to be interested in forging a relationship.</p>

              <h6 class="mt-0 mb-3">Strength</h6>
              <p>Users who join Shapr are going in with the intention of meeting people so the likelihood of a response and meeting in person are much higher.</p>
              <h6 class="mt-0 mb-3">Weakness</h6>
              <p>This model of networking mirrors dating apps. Employing the same user flow of swiping, matching, and chatting makes the experience feel unprofessional and blurs the line between personal and professional.</p>

          <p>To figure out the features of Get Together, we first completed a few rapid sketching exercises to quickly get our thoughts on paper.

          <h3 class="container-title">Next Steps</h3>
          <p>Atttending events is a significant part of networking and our solution, so in our next step we would build a tool so users can create the events. In this way, there would be enough events covering different interests. We also want users to be able to strengthen their relationships after attending an event. By integrating the existing groups feature in LinkedIn, multiple users can communicate and get updates about events that they can all attend together.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 mx-auto">
          <h3 class="container-title">Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>Through designing Get Together, my team and I learned how willing people are to connect with others but how reluctant they are to meet in person. Our goal with this concept was to help facilitate meaningful interactions by taking their online relationship into the real world. LinkedIn already has half of the solution—helping users connect with people they already know. However, they haven’t solved for the other half, which is helping users discover new people worth meeting.</p>
